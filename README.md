Virus Defense libGDX port
==========================
This is a port of [Virus Defense](https://github.com/Valep42/VirusDefense) from Slick2d to libGDX.
The newest version exists on the develop branch.

Notes:
This was forked from [Virus Defense libGDX wrapped](https://github.com/Valep42/VirusDefense-libGDX-wrapped).
Which was forked from [this](https://github.com/badlogic/theplanethatcouldntflygood), but basically just as a basis to get the libGDX structure to work with eclipse and github.
